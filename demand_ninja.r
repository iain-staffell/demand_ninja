##   ##      DEMAND.NINJA MODEL
#####
##
#
#
#    this model performs the 'core' demand.ninja calculations
#    it delivers an hourly time-series of energy demand for a 
#    given location, for a given set of temperaure thresholds
#    and BAIT (building-adjusted internal temperature) values
#    which describe the characteristics of a building and its
#    occupants. the main function `demand_ninja` uses weather
#    data from the dev.renewables.ninja website for a desired
#    location, processes this into the BAIT temperature index
#    and then finally calculates energy demand.
#
#
#
#  MAIN USER FUNCTIONS:
#
#    read weather data from the renewables.ninja site  
#       read_ninja_weather = function(filename)
#
#    turn this weather data and your parameters into demand
#       demand_ninja = function(weather, bait, nrg)
#
#
#
#
#  OTHER BACKGROUND FUNCTIONS:
#
#    a list holding data about your api requests
#    used to keep track of your usage limits
#       apilog$...
#
#
#    for converting weather into BAIT:
#        ninja_temperature_index = function(weather, bait)
#        smooth_temperatures = function(temperature, weights)
#
#    calculating degree days:
#        HDD = function(temperature, threshold)
#        CDD = function(temperature, threshold)
#
#    converting BAIT into demand:
#        ninja_energy_demand = function(time, temperature, nrg)
#
#    other bits and bobs:
#
#    background functions to build URLs to access the API
#       ninja_build_wind_url = function(lat, lon, ...)
#       ninja_build_solar_url = function(lat, lon, ...)
#       ninja_build_weather_url = function(lat, lon, ...)
#
#    background functions to download and process ninja simulations 
#       ninja_get_url = function(url)
#       ninja_aggregate_urls = function(urls)
#
#    background functions that do other stuff
#       cat_flush(...)
#       format_date(...)
#

#    note there is minimal error checking in these functions!
